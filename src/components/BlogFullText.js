    title: "The Future of Quantum Computing in Education",
    paragraphs: {
      1: "Quantum computing, once a concept confined to physics labs, is now rapidly entering mainstream research and industry. As the technology matures, education will play a critical role in preparing the next generation of innovators capable of using and advancing quantum systems.",
      2: "One of the greatest challenges in teaching quantum computing is its complexity. Traditionally, it has required advanced mathematics and physics, which limited its accessibility. However, new tools are changing this. Cloud-based quantum processors, visual simulators, and beginner-friendly programming frameworks such as Qiskit or Cirq are allowing students to experiment with quantum algorithms without needing a PhD-level background.",
      3: "At the university level, specialized programs in quantum information science and quantum engineering are already emerging. These programs often combine physics, computer science, and engineering, giving students a holistic understanding of the field. Collaboration with industry leaders—such as IBM, Google, and Microsoft—ensures that students not only learn theory but also gain exposure to real-world quantum applications.",
      4: "Looking forward, quantum literacy will not be limited to specialists. Just as coding has become a widely taught skill, basic knowledge of quantum computing may soon be part of a standard curriculum. By offering accessible pathways, education will ensure that students, researchers, and professionals alike are prepared for the quantum future."
